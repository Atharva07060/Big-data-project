## üìä Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time stock price prediction system using historical stock data. It includes:
- ETL pipeline to extract, clean, and transform data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for time series forecasting
- Visualization and performance evaluation

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  
- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance / Kaggle (CSV format)

---

## üîÅ Project Workflow

1. **Extract:** Collect stock data in CSV format  
2. **Transform:** Clean and preprocess the data  
3. **Load:** Save the transformed data for modeling  
4. **Modeling:** Use LSTM to predict future prices  
5. **Evaluation:** Plot and compare actual vs predicted values

---

## üßº ETL Pipeline

- **Extract:**  
  Loaded historical stock data using CSV files.

- **Transform:**  
  - Handled missing values  
  - Converted date formats  
  - Engineered new features like:
    - 7-day & 30-day Moving Averages  
    - Daily Returns  
  - Scaled features using `MinMaxScaler` to normalize values in [0, 1] range.

- **Load:**  
  The transformed data was saved as new CSV files or used directly in modeling.

## üß† LSTM Model

- **Model Type:** Long Short-Term Memory (RNN)  
- **Features Used:** Close price  
- **Window Size:** 60 days (used to predict the next day)  
- **Architecture:**
  - 2 LSTM layers
  - Dropout layer (to prevent overfitting)
  - Dense output layer
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, Line Chart Visualization

---

## üìà Visualizations

- Stock closing price over time  
- Moving averages and daily returns  
- Predicted vs Actual closing price (line plot)

---

## üìä Results

- The LSTM model was able to capture the trends in the data.
- It performed reasonably well in predicting future prices.
- Visualizations showed close alignment between actual and predicted prices.

---

## üöß Challenges Faced

- **Overfitting:** Solved using Dropout and early stopping  
- **Scaling:** Resolved using MinMaxScaler  
- **Time-Series Sequencing:** Handled using sliding window technique (last 60 days to predict next)
